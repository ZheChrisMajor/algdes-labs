# Red Scare - README

## Requirements
In order to be able to run the code, you will need to pip install **igraph**, as well as **matplotlib** although we assume that most have the latter installed already. 

```
pip install igraph
pip install matplotlib
```

## Running the code
Currently the code can be run directly from the command line by piping a data file into the main file using the following command; 
`python main.py < <path to file>`.

## Running all the data
Run `python ./code/filesmuggler.py` from a parent directory containing both our `/code/` folder and the `/data/` folder to run through all the data files. Results will be written to `result.txt`.
